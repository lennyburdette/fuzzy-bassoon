in bus monitor view:

- remove timestamps from each row
- remove status indicator (the available buttons actually convey status)
- sort buses only by alphabetical/numerical
- add a header row for "departed" and put all departed buses under that header (pending and arrived buses are in a combined list at the top)
- don't make the footer in the mobile layout fixed. use a light gray background and make it look recessed compared to the main content
